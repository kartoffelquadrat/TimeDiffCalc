# Time Diff Calc

Speeding up time marker analysis.

## About

For my studies I need to analyze a many videos for time spent on given tasks.  
The procedure is to fast-forward through the video, identify the time markers where tasks alternate and note the time delta for the resulting intervals.  
This repo hosts a little helper calculator webpage written in plain HTML and JavaScript.


## Usage

 * Open in [browser](https://kartoffelquadrat.github.io/TimeDiffCalc/).   
 * If needed, add to iOS HomeScreen via sharing shortcut, to get an eternal app.  
There is no remotely changing content, so the static page contents will work offline.

### Key Combos

 * Use "Tab" to iterate over fields.
 * Hit "Enter" memorize and start over.
